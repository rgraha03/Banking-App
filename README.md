# Mock-Banking-App
Final project coded in Python for my Introduction to Computing class

This mock banking app allows you to view your balances, enter and view trasanctions, transfer money across accounts, write a digital check, and print out a statement. When launched, the program will display a menu with buttons that would redirect you to the pages of these options. The user will be able to add one or multiple bank accounts (checking and/or savings) and deposit money into them. Money can also be withdrawn. The program will also allow the user to enter transactions to affect the balance of their account. Bank statements displaying details and activities done through the bank account can be printed out to an output file. You are also able to log in to the app with a password.
